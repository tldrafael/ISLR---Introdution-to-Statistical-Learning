# ISLR---Introdution-to-Statistical-Learning


This repository intends to publish notes and answers from my studies of the *ILSR* book and to help who else are studying it.

My annotations and answers correspond my conceptual understanding and my researchs to accomplish them, they're not necessary the correct answers, please feel free to comment and correct me if needed, thanks.

Information about the book can be accessed [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), the book is also available for download. Thanks to the authors *Gareth James*, *Daniela Witten*, *Trevor Hastie* and *Robert Tibshirani*.
